- Windows Vista/7/8/8.1/10/11, Linux (Ubuntu, Debian, including Raspberry Pi OS, Arch Linux, Fedora, Gentoo, openSUSE or Mageia) or MacOS <10.9 Mavericks. Just about any OS will work.

## Error code meanings ❌
All errors come in x64 (64-bit) and x86 (32-bit) varients, depending on what you set the processor type to.
- 55-73-65-72 - User-initiated crash using $ STOPCRASH $ command
- 50-50-72-6F - Error opening the PythOS Pro uttillity[^2].

[^1]: @captainawesomejnr has tried _Python Interpreter_ and _Python3IDE_ for iPad which both use Python 3.5 and the `input` command resulted in an error. However, coding books say differently so just stick away from those apps.
[^2]: Caused by trying to open PythOS Pro while unactivated. Activation is a safety feature. 
[^3]: Tested on a Pi 3 A+.
[^4]: Stable versions will have MUCH LESS bugs that, otherwise, will make PythOS inoperable!
